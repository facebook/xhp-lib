Some attributes are not mentioned at all in the spec,
however they appear on real documents and the attributes are valid attributes.
I don't know if it is implicitly permitted by another spec that svg builds on though.

`<svg version="..." />`
`version` is a valid attribute, but it is not mentioned anywhere in the spec.
